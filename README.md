## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.10.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- Firebase project setup
- Camera-enabled device

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alpharibbin/facerecognition.git
   cd facerecognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Setup Firebase**
   - ⚠️ **Important**: This repository does NOT include Firebase configuration files
   - Follow the instructions in [SETUP_FIREBASE.md](SETUP_FIREBASE.md) or [docs/FIREBASE.md](docs/FIREBASE.md)
   - Run `flutterfire configure` to set up Firebase for your project
   - This will generate the required Firebase configuration files

4. **Add model files**
   - Place `facenet.tflite` in `assets/models/` directory
   - The model will be automatically loaded from assets on first use

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

### Register a Face

![Face Registration Process](assets/images/facecapture.jpeg)

1. Click the **"+"** button on the View All page
2. Enter email address in the verification page
3. (Optional) Click **"Verify"** to check if user exists
4. Enter or edit name (always enabled)
5. Click **"Continue"** or **"Add New"** to proceed to registration
6. Position face in the camera view
7. Click **"Capture & Register"** to capture 3 images and register

### Detect Faces

![Face Detection](assets/images/singleface.jpeg)

1. Click **"Detect Face"** on the home page
2. Point camera at faces
3. The app will automatically detect and identify registered faces
4. Supports both single and multiple face detection

### View Registered Faces

![View All Registered](assets/images/viewalllist.jpeg)

1. Click **"View All"** on the home page
2. Browse all registered faces
3. Use search to filter by name or email
4. Double-tap a face to:
   - View details
   - Register again
   - Delete (with confirmation)

## Firebase Structure

The app uses Firebase Firestore with the following structure:

```
users/
  {email}/  # Document ID is the email address
    - name: string
    - embedding: array<number>
    - face_updated_at: timestamp
```

## Requirements

- **Android**: Minimum SDK 21
- **iOS**: iOS 12.0 or higher
- **Camera**: Required for face capture and detection
- **Internet**: Required for Firebase sync (offline mode available)
